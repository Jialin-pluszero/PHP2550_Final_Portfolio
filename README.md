# Portfolio: Data Analysis and Prediction Model Projects

This portfolio contains three projects that represent a blend of exploratory data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, developed through collaborations with esteemed academics from Brown University. Each project addresses significant issues in public health and predictive modeling.

## Project Summaries

### Project 1: Analyzing the Impact of Smoking During Pregnancy
**Collaborator:** Dr. Lauren Micalizzi, Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Brown University

#### Overview
This project delves into the exploratory data analysis of smoking during pregnancy and postpartum periods. It highlights the effects of prenatal and postnatal smoking on adolescents' behaviors, substance use, and self-regulation.

### Project 2: Predictive Modeling for Tracheostomy Needs in Infants
**Collaborator:** Dr. Chris Schmid, Biostatistics Department, Brown University

#### Overview
Focused on infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, this study develops a logistic regression model to predict the necessity of tracheostomy. The project compares variable selection methods, including lasso and forward stepwise selection, to enhance predictive accuracy.

### Project 3: Evaluating Prediction Model Performance in Different Populations
**Collaborator:** Dr. Jon Steingrimsson, Biostatistics Department, Brown University

#### Overview
This project evaluates the transportability of prediction models between different populations. It involves tailoring prediction models based on source population data and assessing their performance in target populations, particularly when only covariate data is available.

## Contributions and Findings

- **Project 1:** Demonstrated a strong correlation between smoking during pregnancy and negative outcomes in adolescence. Utilized various data analysis techniques to draw meaningful insights.
- **Project 2:** Established a robust predictive model for tracheostomy requirements, showcasing the superiority of the forward stepwise selection method over lasso.
- **Project 3:** Successfully transported a prediction model to a different target population, highlighted by the analysis of Brier scores. Conducted a simulation study to validate the transportability of the model.
